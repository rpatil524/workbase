# Introducing TypeDB Studio

TypeDB Studio is the IDE for developing with **[TypeDB](https://github.com/typedb/typedb)**. It provides a consistent experience across different environments, including macOS, Linux, and Windows. With Studio, developers can easily manage databases, execute queries, and explore query results, all within a unified interface.

- [Install TypeDB Studio](https://typedb.com/docs/home/install-tools#_studio)
- For a quick overview of TypeDB Studio, check out the [manual](https://typedb.com/docs/manual/tools/studio).

## Features

TypeDB Studio helps you get started developing with TypeDB faster:

- Graphical user interface for connecting to TypeDB without the use of command line tools, libraries, or Driver API.
- Database manager to create and delete databases.
- Project file management to store your favorite queries.
- Convenient multi-tab query editor with TypeQL syntax highlighting, auto-saving, query execution, response output, 
  and pop-up notifications for warnings and error messages that may occur during runtime/query execution.
- Automatic transaction management with full GUI control, including read/write/schema transactions, as 
  well as transaction control (commit/rollback/close).

## Download TypeDB Studio

You can download TypeDB Studio from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/typedb/typedb-studio/releases) page.
For more information on how to install and run TypeDB Studio, see the 
[Installation guide](https://typedb.com/docs/home/install-tools#_studio).

## Compile from source

> Note: For precompiled releases, simply download TypeDB Studio following the _"Download TypeDB Studio"_ section above.

1. Make sure you have the following dependencies installed on your machine:
    - Java JDK 11 or higher
    - [Bazel 6 or higher](https://bazel.build/install).
 
2. You can build TypeDB with either one of the following commands, depending on the targeted architecture and 
   operating system: 
   ```sh
   $ bazel run //:studio-bin-mac-arm64
   $ bazel run //:studio-bin-mac-x86_64
   ```
   ```sh
   $ bazel run //:studio-bin-windows-x86_64
   ```
   ```sh
   $ bazel run //:studio-bin-linux-arm64
   $ bazel run //:studio-bin-linux-x86_64
   ```
   You can also replace `run` with `build` in the command above, and Bazel will simply produce the JAR for TypeDB Studio
   under `bazel-bin/studio-bin-mac-x86_64.jar` or similar directory, with respect to the chosen OS and architecture.
